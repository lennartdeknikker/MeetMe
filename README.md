# MeetMe Dating Application
## Description
In my experience conversations in dating apps are really superficial. It’s too easy to forget to answer for a day or two or just lose interest when someone doesn’t answer right away. Because of that it’s not always easy to go from starting a conversation to planning a date, but there’s even more obstacles. People don’t always live in the same city and they’re not always available.

This application will help people to impulsively go on a date. There's no need for waiting, you can just change your status whenever you're available, show others what activities you'd like to do and find someone to go on a date with right away.

## Installation
Use the clone repository:
`https://github.com/lennartdeknikker/MeetMe.git`

`npm install`

The feature will be installed to your system path.

## Usage
